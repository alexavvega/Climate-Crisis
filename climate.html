            <p>Over the past few decades, migratory monarch butterfly populations have
                seen devastating declines. The western population has dropped by 99.9%,
                from around 10 million butterflies in the 1980s to fewer than 2,000 in
                2021. In the east, the population has fallen by 84% since 1996. These
                numbers reflect more than just a species in trouble—they point to a
                broader ecological imbalance driven by human activity. Without immediate
                action, monarchs could disappear entirely from the wild.</p>

            <h1 class="image-text">2. Climate Change Disrupts Migration Patterns</h1>
            <p>
                Monarch butterflies rely on environmental cues like temperature and
                daylight to guide their migration. However, climate change has caused
                unpredictable weather patterns, leading some butterflies to migrate
                earlier or farther than normal. These mistimed migrations often result
                in butterflies arriving before milkweed—their essential food source—is
                available. Prolonged droughts and severe storms also destroy habitats
                and directly kill millions of monarchs. These disruptions can lead to
                reproductive failure and weaken the overall population year after year.

            <p>
                Milkweed is the only plant monarch caterpillars eat, making it
                absolutely essential for their survival. Unfortunately, this vital plant
                is under threat from climate change and pesticide use. As temperatures
                rise, milkweed produces more cardenolide, a toxin that protects it from
                predators but can also harm monarch larvae. Habitat loss from
                urbanization and agriculture has also led to a massive decline in
                milkweed availability across North America. Without enough healthy
                milkweed, monarch butterflies cannot successfully reproduce.

            <h1 class="image-text">4. Habitat Loss from Fires and Farming</h1>
            <p>
                The monarch’s overwintering forests in Mexico and California are being
                destroyed by logging, agriculture, and wildfires, many of which are made
                worse by climate change. These areas provide shelter during cold months,
                and without them, monarchs cannot survive the winter. Deforestation—both
                legal and illegal—has already wiped out large portions of these critical
                habitats. Urban sprawl and pesticide-heavy farming continue to push the
                butterflies out of their breeding and resting areas. This ongoing loss
                of shelter makes long-term survival incredibly difficult.

            <h1 class="image-text">5. Monarchs Help Feed the Planet</h1>
            <p>
                Monarch butterflies are part of a larger network of pollinators that
                support ecosystems and agriculture. Alongside bees, bats, and birds,
                monarchs help fertilize plants by transferring pollen, enabling fruits,
                vegetables, and flowers to grow. As their populations decline, the
                ripple effects can be felt across food systems and biodiversity. If
                monarchs migrate too far north due to warmer springs, they may not
                survive the longer return trip south. This strain reduces reproduction
                and weakens pollination cycles across North America.

            <h1 class="image-text">6. Hope Through Action</h1>
            <p>
                Despite the alarming decline in monarch butterfly numbers, there is
                hope. Communities, scientists, and conservationists are coming together
                to plant native milkweed, reduce pesticide use, and restore natural
                habitats. By supporting efforts to protect overwintering forests and
                creating pollinator-friendly gardens, individuals can help monarchs
                recover. These small but powerful actions can help reverse the
                butterfly’s path toward extinction. Together, we can ensure future
                generations experience the magic of monarch migration.
